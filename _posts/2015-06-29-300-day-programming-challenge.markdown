They say it takes 21 days to start a new habit, but how many days does it take to start a new career? This is a question I hope to answer in the 300 day programming challenge that I am about to embark on.

#THE CHALLENGE:#
Like anything else on the internet, this idea started in a chat room. My friend Marius and I took a development course in iOS Programming through Bloc. He created a Slack channel for fellow iOS Bloc alumni and I help him with administrating it. Next week is the World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, CA. If you haven’t heard about it, WWDC is Apple’s yearly developer conference where they take an in-depth look at Apple’s up and coming technologies. We decided that it is imperative for us to attend as full-time iOS developers at next year’s conference. There is only one problem with this idea: We aren’t currently full-time iOS developers.

So on June 1st, after that conversation, we decided that we would set out on a 300 day programming challenge. By the end of this challenge, our goal is to be full-time iOS developers.

#THE PASSION:#
After taking Bloc’s iOS development course, I knew that this was the career for me. Just like any other language, programming languages are perpetually evolving. This constant evolution creates a never-ending stream of subjects to learn more about. Another thing I loved about programming was the feeling I got when seeing my finished work. There is an intense rush that programmers get when they see their vision become a reality. This rush also comes with a downside… sometimes your code doesn't work, sometimes it does.

#THE GLORY:#
With the start of this challenge, I also want to challenge you. Is there a change in your life that you want to make? Is there something that is so close within your reach that you can just feel it? Go out and do that thing. Make small steps every day. You only get one shot at this life, and your passions are something you should pursue.
